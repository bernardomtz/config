This repository is for mistakes and bad practices. Why do I decided to source control that? well, at some point the code here was useful for something and it helps to me creating a mental anchor for the problems I have solved and the learnings I acquired. Many of the lines here made birth to ideas for new peojects on my job or other personal projects.
So, if you landed here feel free to look arround. But keep in mind that I wouldn't use the code here for production. The code here outside of the context at where I created wouldn't be helpful or even could be considered harmful.
So if you ever take something from here TAKE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
