This repository contains scripts that use on a daily basis, in the free time I have left for coding
after working hours, the code here was useful at some point to perform soeme specific tasks in a specific,
context, you might find even code I wrote when I was a college student.
So if you ever take something from here TAKE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
